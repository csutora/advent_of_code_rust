# advent_of_code_rust
a framework for advent of code so i don't have to write a lot of boilerplate code every day. \
the repo also contains my solutions in the `year_YYYY` folders.

some stuff it does:
- automatically reads inputs from the advent of code website
- has a caching mechanism to not put additional load on their server
- can run any of your hierarchically organized solutions
- requires the minimum amount of boilerplate code i could achieve while still keeping it readable
- but mainly: it was fun to write

if you for any reason want to use it, the files are commented with anything important. \
i recommend starting with the comment at the top of `main.rs`, that should explain everything.
